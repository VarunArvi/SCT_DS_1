# Population Analysis-Report


## Task

Creation of a bar chart to visualize the distribution of categorical variables, for a population dataset. The population dataset being used for this report is in the form of several CSV files.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Loading of data into Power BI Desktop software tool, by sourcing the data from the population dataset.
- Step 2 : Opening of power query editor to create tables and edit them, based on the analysis requirement. 
- Step 3 : Various tables created include Population, Year and Income_Dist.
- Step 4 : A graph of population size versus country name has been constructed.
- Step 5 : Income group is the legend for this graph, enabling the comparison of income levels of the people belonging to the various countries of the world. The several income levels are high, low, upper middle, lower middle, etc. 
- Step 6 : A visual filter (Slicer) has been added for the graph. This slicer, which consists of tiles representing all the years from 1960 to 2021, can be used to analyse the graph data over a large period of time. This helps in determining trends and enhancing accuracy of findings.  
- Step 7 : Formatting of the visuals aids in faster data analysis. It also ensures that the quality of analysis is massively enhanced.
